# MyTasks

GUI application to manage personal tasks developed in Python

The application will be able to work in a "console" mode and GUI as well.

The menu.py file has been developed for the console mode functionality.

The run.py launches the application

```
python run.py
```

To launch the application in a console mode, it should be called from a terminal using "c" as argument (Not implemented at this moment)

```
python run.py c
```
